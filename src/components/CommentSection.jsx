              Today I was mob programming with Square's Mobile &amp; Performance
              Reliability team and we toyed with an interesting idea. Our
              codebase has classes that represent screens a user can navigate
              to. These classes are defined in modules, and these modules have
              an owner team defined. When navigating to a screen, we wanted to
              have the owner team information available, at runtime. We created
              a build tool that looks at about 1000 Screen classes, determines
              the owner team, and generates a class to do the lookup at runtime.
              The generated code looked like this:
              <br />
              mapOf(vararg pairs: Pair) is a nice utility to create a map (more
              specifically, a LinkedHashMap) but using that syntax leads to the
              creation of a temporary vararg array of size 1000, as well as 1000
              temporary Pair instances. Memory hoarding Let's look at the
              retained size of the map we just created: ~30 characters per class
              name * 2 bytes per character = 60 bytes per entry Each entry is
              stored as a LinkedHashMapEntry which adds 2 references to
              HashMap.Node which itself holds 3 references and 1 int. On a 64bit
              VM that's 5 references * 8 bytes, plus 4 bytes for the int: 44
              bytes per entry. So for the entries alone we're at (60 + 44) *
              1000 = 104 KB. The default load factor is 75%, which means the
              size of the array backing the hashmap must always be at least 25%
              greater than the number of entries. And the array size has to be a
              factor of 2. So, for 1000 entries, that's an object array of size
              2048: 2048 * 8 = 16,314 bytes. The total retained size of the map
              is ~120 KB. Can we do better? Could we make it... 0?
              <h2 className="font-bold text-3xl mt-4">100% code-based map</h2>
              What if we generate code that returns the right team for a given
              screen, instead of creating a map? Since we know the full list of
              screen classes, we can check ahead of time whether there's any
              hashcode conflict, and if not, we can generate code that directly
