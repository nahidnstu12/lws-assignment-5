                  Today I was mob programming with Square's Mobile &amp;
                  Performance Reliability team and we toyed with an interesting
                  idea. Our codebase has classes that represent screens a user
                  can navigate to. These classes are defined in modules, and
                  these modules have an owner team defined. When navigating to a
                  screen, we wanted to have the owner team information
                  available, at runtime. We created a build tool that looks at
                  about 1000 Screen classes, determines the owner team, and
                  generates a class to do the lookup at runtime. The generated
                  code looked like this:
                </p>
              </div>
